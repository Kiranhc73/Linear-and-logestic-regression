# Linear Regression on Boston Housing Data and Logistic Regression on Churn Data

This repository contains the code and results for linear regression on the Boston housing data and logistic regression on churn data.

## Linear Regression on Boston Housing Data

### Project Overview

In this project, we applied linear regression to predict housing prices in the Boston area using the Boston housing dataset. The goal was to build a model that could accurately estimate the price of a house based on its features.

### Results

The performance of the linear regression model on the Boston housing data is as follows:

- Variance Score: 74%

## Logistic Regression on Churn Data

### Project Overview

The objective of this project was to predict customer churn using logistic regression. Churn prediction is crucial for businesses to identify customers who are likely to leave and take proactive measures to retain them. We trained a logistic regression model on churn data to classify customers as churned or not churned.

### Results

The performance of the logistic regression model on the churn data is as follows:

- Accuracy: 82%

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `linear_regression/`: Directory containing the code and results for linear regression.
  - `linear_regression.py`: Python script to perform linear regression on the Boston housing data.
  - `linear_regression_results.txt`: Text file containing the results and evaluation metrics of the linear regression model.

- `logistic_regression/`: Directory containing the code and results for logistic regression.
  - `logistic_regression.py`: Python script to perform logistic regression on the churn data.
  - `logistic_regression_results.txt`: Text file containing the results and evaluation metrics of the logistic regression model.

## Usage

To replicate the results, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/linear-logistic-regression.git`
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Navigate to the `linear_regression/` directory and run the `linear_regression.py` script to perform linear regression on the Boston housing data.
4. Navigate to the `logistic_regression/` directory and run the `logistic_regression.py` script to perform logistic regression on the churn data.

Feel free to explore the code and make any necessary modifications to suit your specific use case.

## Conclusion

The linear regression model achieved a variance score of 74% on the Boston housing data, indicating that it can explain 74% of the variance in the housing prices. The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 82% on the churn data, demonstrating its ability to classify customers as churned or not churned.
